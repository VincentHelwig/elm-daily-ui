This is a revisited version of the daily Ui Challenge in ELM.
The main purpose of this initiative is to practice this wonderful language by building some cool stuff.

My inspiration :

- http://www.jackoliver.info/react-daily-ui/
- http://www.dailyui.co/
- http://codepen.io

I'm trying to make all the examples runnable with elm-reactor..
When i will get into ports and subscriptions, I will maybe need to change that ... but for now it works :-)
